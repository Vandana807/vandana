<h3>PROJECT</h3>
<h2>Land Registration using Blockchain Technology</h2>
<p> Blockchain is a comprehensive solution to shield the vulnerabilities in 
many sectors  which are prone to corruption and human error. The Land 
Registry is one of the cases where there can be a lot of human interventions 
which can cause errors intentionally or unintentionally. Apart from that there 
are many cases of fraud, falsified identities and forged documents and even a 
complete record loss within paperwork. When there are thousands of records 
to be maintained and tracked it is obvious that integrity and safety is tampered 
in one way or other. There is no proper solution to this. The transparent nature 
of the blockchain will make this possible by not involving any middleman 
other than the land Inspector while an ownership of a land is transferred. The 
immutability and traceability provided by the Blockchain helps in 
implementing decentralized technology within the process of land 
registration. </p>
